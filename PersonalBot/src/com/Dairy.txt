About Today: Hi, it's been ages, always ages. I'm very inconsistent but it's grand. I think i'm done with my app. Also, i think i'm going through a burn out. But I'm surviving. I can't see you yourself you're not doing too good because of lack of miantainance. I just found ou that all the selinuim depenedecies are broken i promise to fix you tommorrow. I just noted it down on my sticky note. I've actually been lonely but not lonely with my computer. that guy always keeps me company. I am learining stacks, generics & queues. They're not too bad. Also i need to start leetcode. I must have said this b4 but i neva really put the effort. That's too bad yunno. I failed my maths test on wednesday. Too bad i now have to study hard to makeup. Nothing else is really happpening i need to do a video of the app , upload source code to git hub and submit that all for now. I'm hungery I'd talk late, I might start reading a little life today. We'd see.
Lesson Learnt Today: Absolutely nothing just leaving on autopilot. But podomoro session was actually productive. I just got tired & hungery
